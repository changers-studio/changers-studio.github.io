										Please read this Privacy Policy (<span class="_highlighted"
											>"Policy"</span
										>) carefully before using the services provided by Code Forge LLC
										(<span class="_highlighted">"Company"</span>). The Company is a
										limited liability company, incorporated and acting under the laws of
										Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, company number 3584 LLC 2024, having
										its registered address at Euro House, Richmond Hill Road, Kingstown,
										St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
									</p>
									<p>
										If you are accessing or using our System and Services, you agree to be
										bound by applicable Terms and Conditions (<span class="_highlighted"
											>"Terms"</span
										>), as well as our Policy (which also includes our Cookie Policy) and
										any other applicable policies from time to time. If you do not agree
										to any of these, you must not use our Services and System.
									</p>
									<p>
										All definitions and rules set forth in the Terms are applicable to
										this Policy.
									</p>
									<p class="mb-6">
										This Policy explains how the Company collects, uses, discloses, and
										protects Users' personal information while providing its Services
										through the Bot, Forum, Website, Guide, and other digital platforms
										(collectively, the <span class="_highlighted">"System"</span>). By
										accessing and using the System, Users expressly agree to the terms
										outlined in this Policy.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="info__container-inner">
									<h2 class="info__heading">1. Company as a data controller</h2>
									<div class="info__text">
										1.1. This Policy is prepared in accordance with the best practices and
										principles of data protection, with the goal to ensure User’s personal
										data is processed fairly and lawfully, while the Company is using data
										only for specified purposes, ensuring data accuracy, retaining data
										only as necessary, and implementing appropriate security measures to
										protect against unauthorized access or breaches.
									</div>
									<div class="info__text">
										1.2. The Company is typically the “data controller” of any personal
										information provided to the Company. Very occasionally, the Company
										might act on specific retainers as a “processor” (by processing
										personal data only in accordance with the directions of a data
										controller).
									</div>
									<div class="info__text _offset-right">
										1.2.1. A data controller is a person or organization that determines
										the purposes and means of processing personal data. In other words,
										the data controller decides why and how personal data should be
										processed and is responsible for ensuring compliance with data
										protection requirements.
									</div>
									<div class="info__text _offset-right">
										1.2.2. A data processor is a person or organization that processes
										personal data on behalf of a data controller, following the
										controller’s instructions. The processor does not own or control the
										data but handles it for specific tasks like storing, analyzing, or
										transferring information.
									</div>
									<div class="info__text">
										1.3. The Company, as a data controller (or in some cases – data
										processor), has the following obligations:
									</div>
									<div class="info__text _offset-right">
										1.3.1. Data transfers. The Company shall not transfer personal data to
										country or territory outside the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
										unless that country ensures an adequate level of protection for the
										rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of
										personal data.
									</div>
									<div class="info__text _offset-right">
										1.3.2. Data processing records. The Company shall keep data processing
										records upon its own decision, unless such record keeping is mandatory
										legal requirement.
									</div>
									<div class="info__text _offset-right">
										1.3.3. Data protection officer appointment. The Company may assign a
										data protection officer to ensure proper data protection requirement
										implementation and optimization of procedures upon its own decision or
										mandatory legal requirement.
									</div>
									<div class="info__text _offset-right">
										1.3.4. Data breach notification. The Company strives to protect your
										personal data in the best way possible. However, sometimes data
										breaches occur, and such event can happen for various reasons. In the
										case of a data breach that would prejudice the privacy,
										confidentiality and security of the personal data of a data subject,
										the Company, as a data controller, immediately upon becoming aware of
										such breach, shall notify the authorized authority and you (if needed)
										of such data breach and take action to eliminate or minimize the harm.
									</div>
									<div class="info__text _offset-right">
										1.3.5. Data retention. The Company shall not store personal data after
										the completion of the purpose for which such data was processed unless
										the identity of the data subject is no longer identifiable through the
										use of anonymization techniques.
									</div>
									<div class="info__text _offset-right">
										1.3.6. Sensitive personal data protection. In general, the Company
										does not process any special categories of personal data from Users.
										This includes data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political
										opinions, religious or ideological convictions or trade union
										membership, as well as genetic and biometric data. In some cases,
										during verification, in addition to the actual verification data (e.g.
										screenshots of ID documents and identification data from them, place
										of residence, status of politically exposed persons, video data,
										etc.), biometric data (e.g. personal data resulting from specific
										technical processing in connection with the physical, physiological or
										behavioral characteristics of a person and data for the clear
										identification of a person, e.g. facial images, dactyloscopic data)
										are recorded. Such processing of biometric data takes place
										exclusively based on your express consent, which you can revoke at any
										time.
									</div>
									<div class="info__text _offset-right">
										1.3.7. Proper agreements between controller and processor. The
										processor shall perform and implement the processing of personal data
										based on the instructions of the controller and in accordance with the
										contracts and agreements entered between them, which shall
										specifically set out the scope, subject-matter, purpose and nature of
										the processing, the type of personal data, and categories of data
										subjects. The Company, either acting as a controller or the processor,
										shall make sure beforehand that such agreements are concluded and are
										proper for planned data processing.
									</div>
									<div class="info__text">
										1.4. If you have any questions regarding the processing of your
										personal data and the exercise of your rights under this Policy, you
										can contact our team at
										<a href="mailto:business@sigma.win">business@sigma.win</a>. To answer
										your inquiry, the Company might require additional identification data
										from you (e.g. Passport, ID card, etc.) – we want to ensure that your
										personal data is only passed on to you.
									</div>
									<div class="info__text">
										1.5. The Company values the trust that you place in the Company when
										using Services/System. For this reason, privacy and data security are
										extremely important to the Company. The Company wants to offer you the
										best possible experience with the System to ensure that you can enjoy
										using Services now and in the future. That is why the Company wants to
										understand user behaviour on the System to continuously improve it.
										The processing of your personal data is therefore not only necessary
										for the provision of Services, but also to improve user-friendliness.
										Therefore, in this Policy you are informed which personal data the
										Company collects from you, how the Company processes it and to whom
										the Company passes it on in detail. In addition, the Company informs
										you about the precautions it takes to protect your personal data, what
										rights you have in this context and who you can contact regarding data
										protection issues.
